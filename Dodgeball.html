    <h1>Dodgeball</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Dodgeball is a game which is usually played by two teams. The teams throw balls at each other while trying to avoid getting hit by the balls.

In the United States, dodgeball is usually played by kids, but internationally, it is gaining popularity in high school and college. Dodge is mostly played on a basketball court, volleyball court, a fenced area, or soccer field.

The number of dodgeballs used varies, but usually it’s around three to ten. At the start of the game, the balls are lined up in the middle of the field. The players will then rush towards the middle, grab the dodgeballs, and roll it to their teammates. After this, they can start throwing towards the opposing team.

        If a player get hits by the ball, and no one catches it, then that player is eliminated. The player must move to the team’s bench area. If a player catches a ball thrown by the opponent, then the player who threw the ball will be eliminated. After a player is eliminated, they may re-enter the field if one of their teammates a ball on the full (provided his team does not already have the maximum number of players).

The sport is well known partly due to the movie in which it was featured - DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, where a group of misfits enter a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament in order to save their local gym from being taken over.

        <br>
In 2017, the World Dodgeball Association was given 'observer status' by the Global Association of International Sports Federations, paving the way for it to be considered officially a sport.
