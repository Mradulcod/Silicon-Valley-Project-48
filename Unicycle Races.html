    <h1>Unicycle Races</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        A unicycle is a cycling vehicle with a single wheel. Unicycling racing is a competition that involves racing using a unicycle.

<br>
 <br>
The sizes of the wheels for track racing are 20 inches, 24 inches, and 29 inches. These races are usually part of some unicycling racing events: 100 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, 30 metres walk the wheel, 50 metres one-foot), 10 kilometres, and marathon.
<br>
        <br>
The competitors must wear shoes, kneepads, gloves, and sometimes a helmet is required. The referee or judge has the final word on whether the competitor's dress is safe enough or not. Finishes are determined by the front fire crossing over the finish line. The competitors are timed by their wheels, and not by their outstretched bodies.
