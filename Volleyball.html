    <h1>Volleyball</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Volleyball is an indoor non-contact team sport in which two teams have three hits to pass a ball over a dividing net. Volleyball was developed by William G. Morgan, a physical education director. He invented the sport called Mintonette which later developed and became volleyball.

Volleyball is played by two teams in a court divided by a net. The teams should have six members each, and can have two substitutes. For mixed games, three males at a time should be on the court. The aim of the game is for each team to send the ball to the opposing team's court.
<br>
        <br>
A team can hit the ball three times to return it to the opposing team. A rally continues if the teams can send it back to back, it will end if the ball touches the ground, or if one of the teams doesn't return it properly. Volleyball matches are played to the best of five sets. The first four sets are played to 25 points, with the final set being played to 15 points. A team must win a set by two points. The teams change courts at the end of each set.
