    <h1>Underwater Hockey</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Underwater Hockey is an underwater sport that is similar to hockey. This game is usually played in a swimming pool, where the players push a puck along the bottom. This game is also called Octopush (in the UK) and UWH.

<br>
 <br>
The teams have up 10 members each, with 6 playing the competition. The game consists of two halves, usually ten to fifteen minutes each half. Players wear snorkels and have to come up for air every now and then.
<br>
        <br>
Some of the equipment used include mask, snorkel, fins, stick, puck, hat, hlove, and a goal. The sticks are about 30 cm long and the puck is heavier than usual (about 1.3 kg) so that it stays at the bottom.
