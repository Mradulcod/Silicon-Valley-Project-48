    <h1>Extreme Canoe Slalom</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Extreme Canoe Slalom (originally called Slalom Cross) is a spectator-friendly fast-paced kayaking sport, combining all of canoeing’s white water disciplines. Four athletes race each other on a whitewater course through upstream and downstream gates whilst also completing an Eskimo roll. A sport with similar head-to-head kayak racing is boater-cross (a part of wildwater canoeing), though that is on natural rapids and usually with no gates to negotiate.
    <br>
    <br>
    The competitors race in identical plastic creek boats. They begin side-by-side, sliding down a ramp two meters above the water. From there they battle each along the course, negotiating both downstream and upstream inflatable gates. There is also a compulsory Eskimo roll, which is a complete 360-degree flip.
<br>
    <br>
    
Contact is allowed, though competitors can be disqualified for breaking the start, missing a buoy, dangerous paddling, and failing to complete the Eskimo roll within the allocated area. Unlike in traditional slalom events, the paddlers are allowed to touch the gate poles without incurring a penalty.

        Extreme slalom first appeared on the ICF’s World Cup program in 2015. At Paris 2024, Extreme Canoe Slalom will be featured for the first time on the Olympic program.
<br>
        <br>
Extreme canoe slalom also has similarities to the ice or snow sports of ice-cross downhill, boardercross and ski-cross.
