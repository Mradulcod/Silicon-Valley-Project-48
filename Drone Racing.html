    <h1>Drone Racing</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Drone Racing is a sporting event in which competitors race specially built multi-rotor drones around a natural or specifically designed course. Flying drones started out as a recreational activity by a few enthusiasts, but has gained extreme popularity and led the way for a competitive sport to be born out of it.
<br>
<br>
 
Drone Racing does not fit in the definition of a real sport as it is not a human physical activity, but is included on this list of sports due to similarities to other flying sports.
<br>
        <br>
The drones used for racing are all radio-controlled with cameras fitted to them. All racing competitions conducted today are first-person view races, where pilots control the drones using hand-held controllers, wearing specially designed goggles that project the video feeds from the drone's camera.

    There are three major formats of races conducted in competitions.
<br>
        <br>
Individual time trial: Pilots compete on a course individually against a clock, in which the pilot to navigate the course in the fastest time wins.
        <br>
        <br>
Team time trial: A team time trial event in which pilots compete as a tem to finish the course in the fastest time.
        <br>
        <br>
Freestyle tricks: An event in which the pilot performs various tricks using their drones.
        <br>
        <br>
The sport of drone racing is still in its infancy, with competitions still slowly springing up around the world. The first national level drone-racing competition was conducted in the United States in July 2015, in which 120 participants from various countries took part. In 2021, the professional Drone Racing League held international competitions.
