    <br>
    <p>
        Wallyball is a variation of volleyball, that is played in a court enclosed with walls on all four sides. In wallyball, also called as rebound volleyball, it is legal to bounce the ball off of the walls. The sport which was developed in California is mostly played at a recreational and club level.

Wallyball is mostly played in a racquetball court, with two to six players per side. The net used is 8ft high for men and 7ft 6in for women. There is a service line marked 1ft away on both sides that extends across the length of the course. A ball similar in size to that of a volleyball is used to play the sport.

The gameplay for wallyball is similar to that of volleyball, and starts with a serve. Serves are not allowed to hit the ceiling or the back wall, but are allowed to bounce off of one of the side walls. The play continues with a back and forth rally. The ball can bounce any number of times off the walls and the ceiling but has to be returned in a maximum of three touches.

A modified scoring system is used for wallyball in which teams score points on all serves until a freeze point is reached after which points can only be scored on serves. The freeze point is usually three points less than the winning point.
