    <h1>BaseBall</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Baseball started in England in the mid-18th century as a simple bat-and-ball game. It was brought in North America by immigrants and evolved into a new and very popular sport. It is also the national sport of the United States.
        <br>
    <br>
    There are two teams, nine players in each, and they take turns in batting and fielding. Batting is done by the offense team and the fielding is played by the defense team.
<br>
        <br>
The players of the batting team take turns in batting the ball and once they hit the ball, they need to run counter-clockwise to the bases of the field until they reach the home plate again. They score when they return to the home base before the ball is returned.

    The batting team only has three chances to hit the ball. After that, teams change positions. The fielding team is the one in charge of pitching the ball to the batter and making sure that the ball reaches a particular base before the player of the batting team could.
<br>
        <br>
When both teams have had a turn at batting, an inning is completed. For baseball, there is a total of nine innings and there is no time limit for this sport. The team who scores the greater number of runs wins.
