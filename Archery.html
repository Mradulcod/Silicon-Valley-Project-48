    <h1>Archery</h1>
     <h2>3D Archery</h2>
    <p>3D Archery is a form of archery in which the goal is to strike at targets without knowing exactly how far away the targets are. Besides shooting skills, the archers should also be highly skilled in estimating the distance to the targets. 3D archery is currently practiced both recreationally and competitively.
<br>
        <br>
The targets used for 3D archery are shaped in the form of various animals and their size closely matches that of the life-size animal. The kind of animals used varies with different clubs.
<br>
        <br>
Regardless of the animal type, each target will be marked with a set of scoring rings. Each ring corresponds to a certain number of points, and the smaller the ring the higher the points it carries. The exact points fixed for each ring varies with different clubs, but most clubs award 11 or 12 points for the smallest ring, the ring at the heart carries five points, the lung scores eight, and five for the body.

        <br>
        A match is played for a certain fixed number of targets where each target is placed at a different distance. The player with the most number of points for all targets combined is the winner.
<br>
3D archery, though played competitively, is prevalent only in local clubs and most competitions are only at a club level.

    <h2>Target Archery</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Target Archery is a variation of archery, and it is also the most popular among the variations. Competitors shoot arrows at stationary circular targets at different distances. The players may use all kinds of bows: longbow, barebow, recurve, and compound bows.

    <br>
    <br>
        Target Archery may be indoor or outdoor. It’s usually played indoor during fall and winter. Players compete at a distance of 18 or 25  meters. During spring and summer, target archery is played outdoors. The players compete at a further distance. For adult men it’s 30, 50, 70, and 90 meters. For adult women it’s 30, 50, 60, and 70 meters.

    <h2>Crossbow Archery</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Crossbow archery is a sport of the archery discipline in which a crossbow is used instead of a regular bow. The sport is divided into two major types, match crossbow and field crossbow, depending on the style of shooting.
<br>
        <br>
        Regardless of the type of event, there are two major formats in which competitions are conducted, a 10m match and a 30m match. In the 30m format, the target is placed 30 meters away and competitors will have to take shots both from a standing position and a kneeling position. The 10m format is a highly technical event which takes places on indoor ranges. Competitors shoot at targets that are 10m away in a standing position.
        <br>

<br>
    <br>
A black and white target card is used for both formats, same as the targets used for Olympic air-rifle shooting. Competitors take one shot per card and the same bolt is shot repeatedly. In both formats, each player gets to take 60 shots. The top eight competitors with the highest score will move on to the final championship round where each get ten additional shots. The competitor with the highest total score for all 70 shots is the winner. If multiple competitors have the same score after 70 shots, they continue firing until a winner is decided.
    
    </p>
    <h2>Field Archery</h2>
    
    <p>
    Field archery is one of the more popular adventure and competitive sports played by professional and non-professional archers all around the world. In field archery the shooters aim at 28 targets in a wilderness/nature environment in a sequence, shooting 4 arrows at each target.
        <br>
        <br>    
    Each of the targets are set at different distances and angles and must be shot either up or down depending on the kind of target.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are three types of shooting done in this sport, which are field, hunter and animal. The most commonly shot rounds in this type of archery are "Field" and "Hunter" rounds.
        <br>
        <br>
        In field rounds of this sport the targets are placed at a distance of 80 yards. In hunter rounds the targets are placed at a distance of 70 yards. The targets also vary in size depending on the round being shot at it as well as the distance. Because of the rocky, unsteady terrain of field archery, it makes it significantly more difficult than the flat targets shot at in target archery.
