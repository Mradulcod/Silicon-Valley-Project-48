    <h1>Dragon Boat Racing</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Dragon boat racing is a team paddling sport where the participants use a dragon boat. A dragon boat is a human-powered water vehicle; they were first made in the southern Guangdong Province in China.
<br>
<br>
This sport originated in ancient folk rituals of contending villagers, and competitions have been held for around 2000 years in the southern part of China. In dragon boat racing competitions, the dragon boats are rigged with Chinese dragon heads and tails. In some competitions, the decorative designs are removed, but the drums remain. Dragon boat racing is practiced around East Asia and Southeast Asia, and has been part of the Asian Games.
