        There are rules set by the World Dance Council for international competitions. The music for the competition won’t be revealed until the competition day. The chosen music follows a strict tempo. For couples competition, it will be around 90 seconds to two minutes. Some competitions only employ the basic steps, especially for elementary competitions. International competitions are open, but it should be within the limits of the traditional styles. The “Viennese waltz” has a defined choreography, it is limited to seven well-specified figures.
