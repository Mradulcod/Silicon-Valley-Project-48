    <h1>Javelin Throwing</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
       Javelin or javelin throw is part of the track and field event. A javelin or a spear about 8 feet long is used to throw for maximum distance. The participant runs first within a predetermined area and then throws the javelin.
<br>
<br>
 
The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federation) stated that non-orthodox techniques cannot be used in javelin throw. The participants must hold the javelin at its grip and throw over hands, over the participant’s upper arm or shoulder.
<br>
        <br>
Like other throwing competitions, the participant is not allowed to leave the area until the javelin has landed. The participants throw the javelin towards a sector which has an angle of 28.96 degrees extending outwards from the end of the runway.
