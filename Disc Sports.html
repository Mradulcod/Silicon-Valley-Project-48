    Disc sports or flying disc games, are sports or games played using discs. This sport is often called Frisbee, which is a trademark name for the flying disc. The flying disc was invented by Walter Morrison in 1948. About 10 years later, the company Wham-o brought the rights to the device, and promoted it as a new toy called a Frisbee, which it is popularly known as today.

The most popular disc games are Ultimate Frisbee and Disc Golf. Ultimate Frisbee is a non-contact team sport like American football, but a disc is thrown instead of a ball. Disc Golf is a sport that is similar to golf, with the disc thrown at nets instead of hitting a ball into a hole.

Other competitions involving the Frisbee are disc guts, double disc court, and fricket. There are versions of ultimate called goaltime, hot box, mini ultimate, schtick disc, and kan-jam.
