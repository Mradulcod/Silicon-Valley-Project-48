    <h1>English Billiards</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    English Billiards is a cue sport that originated in Great Britain where it is also simply referred to as Billiards.

<br>
        <br>

 
The sport is played on a table that is of the same size as a snooker table, measuring 11'8" X 5'10", with six pockets around the table. A total of three balls are required, one cue ball for each player, and a red object ball.
<br>
        <br>
At the start of a game, a play called "string", is used to decide which player gets to play first. Then players take turns to make shots and score points. Points are awarded for the following plays :
<br>
        <br>
Cannon: Hits the other cue ball and the object ball in any order in a single shot, carries 2 points.
        <br>
Potting: Pocket the red ball and other cue ball for points 3 and 2 points respectively.
        <br>
In-off: Pocket the cue ball, after the object ball or other cue ball is struck first, for 3 and 2 points respectively.

        Multiple plays can be combined in a single shot to score a maximum of 10 points in one single play. A match is played for a fixed number of points, usually 300, and the player to reach it is the winner.
