The competitors compete into two lifts: the snatch and the clean and jerk. On the snatch, the barbell is lifted from the floor up over the head in a single movement. In the clean and jerk, the competitors lift in two stages. In the first stage, the barbell is picked from the floor, and they pause when it reaches the shoulders. In the 2nd stage, the competitor lifts the barbell over the head.
