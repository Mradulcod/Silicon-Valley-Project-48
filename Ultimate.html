        Ultimate, also called ultimate Frisbee, Flatball or just Frisbee, is a sport played with a flying disc or what is commonly known as Frisbee. The first ultimate game was played at Columbia High School in New Jersey in the 1960â€™s between students.
<br>
        <br>
Ultimate is played with two teams, with seven members teams, sometimes fewer. The aim is to pass the flying disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. The game starts with both teams at opposite ends, and they try to advance the flying disc, or Frisbee, to the other end zone. If a pass is intercepted, the opponent gains possession.
