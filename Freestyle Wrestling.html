Freestyle wrestling is one of the two most popular styles of amateur wrestling. In this style, unlike other styles, wrestlers are allowed to use their legs for offense or defense during a bout. The objective of the sport is to pin down the opponent's shoulders onto the mat. Freestyle wrestling is a major sport that is practiced in most countries around the world.

A match is played for two 30-minute periods. Points, ranging from 1 to 5 are awarded for wrestlers based on their moves on offense. If one player is able to pin the opponent's shoulder onto the ground, called 'win by fall', the player wins immaterial of the points. Points are used to decide the winner in the case where there is no 'win by fall'.
