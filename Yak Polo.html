    <h1>Yak Polo</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Yak polo is a sport that was directly derived from polo, in which yaks are used instead of horses. The sport originated in Mongolia in the early 21st century as a form of tourist attraction, which later gained a lot of attention. Currently several games are being played during the summer months. Besides Mongolia, the only other place where the sport is also played is the Chitral district in Pakistan.

Yak polo is a team sport, played between two five-player teams. One player from each team is designated as the goal keeper. Since yaks are much slower than horses, the field size used in smaller than what is used for polo. There is a small region marked at both ends of the field which serves as the goal line. All players carry a polo stick, and a polo ball is used to play.

The objective of the sport is to score as many goals as possible. the gameplay is exactly same as polo, where teams move the ball towards the goal line by striking it with the sticks. The duration of a match varies and is decided before the start of the match by both teams. The team with the most goals at the end of the match is the winner.
