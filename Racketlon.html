    <h1>Racketlon</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Racketlon is a combination sport, where players compete in the sports of table tennis, tennis, squash, and badminton, with an overall winner determined with the results of each event. The sport originated in Scandinavia, Sweden and Finland. Racketlon is played by two players or two pairs. In racketlon, every point counts. The serve will switch every two points and would always be from the right. The game is played by sets. Each set is played up to 21 points. If the score is tied, another extra tennis point will be allowed to determine the winner.

 <br>
Although this game is played by set, the player with the highest overall score will win the game, not the player who got the highest score per set.The International Racketlon Federation has developed world tour events in countries such as Canada and Europe.
