    <h1>Ski Jumping</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ski jumping is a form of skiing in which an athlete will take off a ramp and jump as high and far as possible. Winning the competition involves displaying the best style and reaching the farthest distance. The sport has four parts: in-run, take-off, flight, and landing. Ski athletes from different parts of the world compete in the Winter Olympic Games.

This sport started in Norway when a Norwegian lieutenant named Olay Rye showcased himself flying 9.5 meters. Now, after two centuries, the sport has developed into a popular Winter Olympic sport.
