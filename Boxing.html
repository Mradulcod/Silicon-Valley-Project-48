    <h1>Boxing</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Boxing is a type of combat sport in which two players throw punches at each other. Back in the days, the main goal of boxing is to knock the opponent unconscious. There are two forms of boxing: amateur boxing and professional.
    <br>
        <br>
    Amateur boxing can be seen in the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, and in the collegiate level. It has a scoring system that will measure the number of clean blows landed by the boxer rather than the physical damage. The boxers are required to wear headgear and gloves, and the gloves should have white strip or circle across the knuckle, this will make the judges score easier.

        Professional boxing bouts are longer than amateur boxing.  In professional boxing, the boxers cannot wear headgear. The boxers are allowed to take more damage before a fight is stopped. The referee can stop the match any time if he thinks that the other boxer cannot defend himself anymore.
