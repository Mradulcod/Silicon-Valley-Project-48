The snooker table measures 11 feet 8 ½ inches by 5 feet 10 inches. The goal of the game is to score more points that the opposing player by potting in correct order the object balls. The aim of the player is to pot one of the red balls to a pocket and then the player scores a point. After the player pots one of the red balls, the player must pot one of the six colors.

A player may also gain points when the opposing player fouls. Fouls include hitting the wrong ball, and also potting the cue ball into a pocket. A snooker match consists of an undetermined number of frames. A frame is basically one game which lasts until the last ball is potted. The player who wins the most number of frames wins the snooker match.
