    <h1>Guts</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Guts is a disc sport derived from dodgeball, where players try to strike their opponents with a frisbee. The sport originated in the United States, and was later spread to Canada and a few other countries.
<br>
        <br>
Guts is played in a court that is split into two halves. The ends of each court is considered as the goal line. Matches can be played with one to five players on each team, but both teams are required to have the same number of players. At the start of the match, each player of one team stands directly opposite to another player of the opposing team across the width of the court.

A player from one team starts by throwing the disc at any player on the opposing team. When a player is about to throw, the opposing team players have to be in a standstill position until the disc has been released.
<br>
        <br>
The objective for the throwing team is to strike the opponents, or fly the disc across the goal line. The objective of the receiving team is to catch the disc in one hand without dropping it, and prevent the disc from going beyond the goal line.
<br>
        <br>
Points are awarded to a team if the opponents drop a catch, strikes any body part except the hands, or if the disc goes past the goal line. A guts match is played for 21 points and a two point differential format.
