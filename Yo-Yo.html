    <h1>Yo-Yo</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        The yo-yo is a popular toy consisting of a string connected to an axle connecting two disks. But to some people it is not just a toy. There are major competitions held throughout the world.
<br>
<br>
 
There is a worldwide competitive circuit of yo-yo tournaments, which culminate in the World Yo-Yo Contest, run by the International Yo-Yo Federation (IYYF). The competition was first held in 1932, and is now held annually. It is the most prestigious yo-yo competition in the world.
