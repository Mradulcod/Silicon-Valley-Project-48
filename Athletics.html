        <h1>Athletics</h1>
 <p>This is a site about the sport of athletics or track and field. Athletics, or Track and Field as it is known in some parts of the world, is composed of many individual and team events. 
         </p>
    <h2>Running</h2>
          <h3>Running events include:-</h3> 
    <br>
        <h2>Sprints</h2>
       <p>
        Sprint running races are short distances races in which athletes try to run at their maximum speed throughout the entire distance of the race. Sprint races are part of the track and field discipline and are included in all events that feature track and field competitions.
        <br>
           
<br>
           The 400m oval running track is split into eight lanes, where each lane is 4ft wide. Up to eight athletes compete in a single race. Competitions are conducted in a heats format, where athletes in groups of eight take part in a every race, with winners moving on to the next round, until the final winner is decided.
           
<br>
           <br>
           Sprint races can be of various distances from 50 - 400m. The three formats used for the Olympics are: 100m, 200m and 400m. The 100m and 400m races are also conducted in a relay format where a team of four each run a leg and pass a baton from one runner to the next.
           <br>
           <br>
           <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/sprinting-pixabay.jpg">
           <br>
           <br>
           For the 100m race all runners are lined up in a straight line in a track, and for the 200m and 400m the start position is based on which lane the athlete is on the track. The runner to first cross the finish line is the winner. The time taken to finish the race for each athlete is also tracked for historical record keeping.
        </p>
        
    <h3>Middle Distance</h3>
    <p>
        Middle distance races are part of the track and field discipline, usually the 800m and 1500m races, though it encompasses all track running races from 800m up to 3km such as the mile. Any longer races on the track as referred to as long-distance races, which comprises of all running races of distances from 3km up including the steeplechase.

<br>
        <br>
        The 800m runners start the race in lanes, though they merge together after about 100m to run along the inside of the track. Longer middle distance races such as the 1500m and mile races start with the runners spread across the track in a line and they immediately race to the inside of the track. As the runners are not restricted to run in their own lane, it enables more jockeying for position and for tactics to play a part, making for exciting finishes to races.
        <br>

        <h3>Long Distance</h3>
        <p>Endurance running, also referred to as long-distance running, is a sport of the track and field discipline, which comprises of all running races of distances from 3kms up to the marathon. The sport has recently been dominated by runners from African countries, who hold the world records for all long-distance races.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several distances for which long-distances races are conducted, of which the most common are the, 5K, 10K, and the marathon (42.2K) races. Some of the other types of endurance running that are less popular are, the half marathon, ultra-marathon and cross-country running.
            <br>
            <br>

In major competitions, the 5K and 10K races are mostly conducted on a track, and the marathon races are conducted on city roads. The Olympics and the World Championships both have races for all the three distances, for both men and women.
<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Though the 5K and 10K races are only conducted as part of a major event, every year, several standalone marathon races are held in various cities around the world, for both men and women. In these races, amateurs are also allowed to take part along with professional runners. Some of the most popular marathons are, New York marathon, Boston marathon, London marathon, Berlin marathon, Chicago marathon, and Tokyo marathon.
</p>
        <h3>Hurdles</h3>
        <p>
        Hurdles or hurdling is a track and field sport that involves running and jumping over obstacles at speed. Hurdling is part of athletics at the Olympic Games. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Hurdling is the basis of a few track and field events. In the said events, obstacles or barriers which are called hurdles are set to which each athlete must jump over. Failure to do so may get an athlete disqualified. The standard hurdle race is 110 meters for men and 100 meters for women. There is also a 400-meter hurdle race for both men and women.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/hurdle-race-pixabay.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
            All these distances are events in the Summer Olympics and the World Championships in Athletics. The 110-meter and 100-meter hurdles are done on a running track, the 400-meter versions covers one whole oval track. There are also shorter distances which are done on indoor tracks, the distances start from 500 meters onwards. Hurdles in track races are usually 68-107 centimeters in height, but sometimes it varies on the age and gender of the participants.
            </p>
        <h3>Relays</h3>
        <p>
        Relay running is a type of running race in which athletes compete as a team, rather than as individuals. The two most common relay races in track and field are the 4 x 100m and the 4 x 400m races, in which four athletes run 100m and 400m each respectively. A less common relay is the sprint medley relay, usually consisting of four legs run at distances of 400, 200, 200, and 800 meters. The latest event to be added to the athletics program is the mixed 4x400m (2 men, 2 women).
<br>
            <br>
The major aspect of a relay race is the baton. The first runner of each team starts the race with a baton. After the first runner completes their part of the run, the baton has to be passed on to the next runner in the team. This continues until the final runner finishes the race with the baton in hand.
<br>
            <br>
During each exchange the athlete receiving the baton is allowed to be in motion before receiving the baton, but cannot go beyond 10m without the baton. If any of the athlete drops the baton, or the runner exceeds the 10m limit, the team will be disqualified.
        <br>
            <br>

        <br>
            <br>
            For the 100m each relay, runners have to stay in their lane for the entire race, whereas for the 400m race, the first runner stay in their lane, the second runner moves into the inside lanes after running their first bend.
<br>
            <br>
Relay running is a part of the track and field events, and is contested during the Olympic Games and the World Championships.
        </p>
   
    <h2>Jumping</h2>
    <h3>Long Jump</h3>
    <p>Long jump is a sport of the track and field discipline in which athletes try to leap forward as far as possible. The event is known to be part of ancient Olympics, and has been a part of modern Olympics since its inception in 1896.
    <br>
        <br>
        To perform a long jump, athletes sprint down a runway and takeoff from a wooden marker board which is about 8 inch wide, and travel as far as possible in the air, before landing into a sand pit. No part of the athlete's foot should cross the takeoff board, if it does, the jump is disqualified. After the jump, the traceable mark on the sand pit, closest to the takeoff board is used to measure the distance of the jump. Each athlete gets three attempts in each round.
<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/long-jumper-pixabay.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        Long jump competitions are part of all track and field events, the most popular of which are the Olympics and the World Championships. Competitions are conducted for both men and women in all events. The men's world record as of 2015 was set by Mike Powell from the United States, recording a 8.95 m jump, and the women's it is 7.52 m, set by Galina Chistyakova.
</p>
    <h3>High Jump</h3>
    <p>The high jump event is part of track and field. The participants attempts to jump over a horizontal bar placed up high without the aid of any devices. The winner is the athlete to successfully clear the highest bar height.
    <br>
        <br>
        The participants can begin jumping at any height which is announced by the judge, they can also pass. They then have three attempts to clear the height. If the height is cleared, they can them attempt the next height, where they will have three more attempts. Once the jumper has three consecutive misses, they are out of the competition and the highest height they cleared is their result.
<br>
        <br>
The participants cannot take off on both feet; they must take off on one foot. A failed jump is when the bar is dislodged by the action of the participant while jumping. The style or technique the participants use must be flawless so that they can have a chance of clearing a high bar.
<br>
        <br>
Special high jump footwear is often used for this event; the shoes have thicker soles and extra grip at the heel to provide stability and support at take off.
        <br>
        <br>

    </p>
    <h3>Triple Jump</h3>
    <p>Triple jump is an athletic sport of the track and field discipline, in which athletes get to take two steps before making the final jump. The first two steps are also referred to as hop and step. The objective of the sport is to cover as much distance as possible in the three leaps.
    <br>
        <br>
        A triple jump field consist of a runway path, a marker line to start the jump from, and a sand pit about 14 feet away from takeoff line. To make the jump, athletes sprint towards the takeoff mark and perform hop, step and jump in one continuous sequence. All three aspects of the triple jump are required to be performed in the correct foot sequence. The foot used for takeoff should be used for landing of the first jump. The second jump should land on the other foot, and the third jump has to be landed with both feet together.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/triple-jumper-pixabay.jpg">
>    <br>
        <br>
        If an athlete oversteps the takeoff mark or misses the foot sequence, the jump is disqualified. Each athlete gets six attempts, and the athlete with the longest jump is declared as the winner.
<br>
        <br>
Triple jump is an Olympic event and is conducted for both men and women. World Championships and all other major athletic events also feature triple jump competitions.
    
    </p>
    <h3>Pole Vault</h3>
    <p>Pole vault is a full medal track and field event at Olympic Games, requiring a competitor to leap over a bar using a long flexible pole made either of carbon fiber or fiberglass. It is one of the four major jumping events in athletics, the other three are high jump, long jump and triple jump. The pole vault has a lot of similarities to high jump.
    <br>
        <br>
        Pole Vault requires high running speed as an essential requirement for a athlete to be able to successfully jump over the bar using the pole. The technique requires a lot of practice and time to be mastered. Inexperienced athletes trying the pole vault can lead to broken poles and injury.
<br>
        <br>
It is crucial to use a pole in accordance to your body weight. Usually there is a red band to indicate recommended range of where to grip the pole. There is a specific area in which pole bends perfectly and the vaulter must take special consideration of that for efficient bending.
    <br>
        <br>
    <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/pole-vault-pd.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        The winner is the athlete to successfully clear the highest bar height. The athlete can choose which height they would like to start. They then have three attempts to clear the height. If the height is cleared, they can them attempt the next height, where they will have three more attempts. Once the vaulter has three consecutive misses, they are out of the competition and the highest height they cleared is their result.


    </p>
    <h2>Throwing</h2>
    <h3>Discus Throw</h3>
    <p>Discus or discus throw, is a track and field event. In this event, the athlete will attempt to throw a heavy disc (called a discus) as far as he/she can.
<br>
        <br>
        There are varying weights for international competitions. Men through age 49 will throw a 2-kilogram discus; 1.5 kilograms for 50-59-year old men’ 1 kilogram for 60 and beyond. For the women through age 74, the discus throw is around 1 kilogram, for women 75 years old; the discus is around .75 kilograms.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/discus-thrower-pd.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        The discus is usually made of plastic, wood, fiberglass, and carbon fiber. For the athletes to make a throw, they will start in a circle of 2.5 meters in diameter. Then the athlete will spin counter clockwise around one and a half time through the circle, then the athlete can release his/her throw.
<br>
        <br>
The discus must land around the 34.92-degree sector. The six key movement of discus throw are: wind up, move in rhythm, balance, right leg engine, orbit, and delivery.
</p>
    <h3>Shot Put</h3>
    <p>Shot put is a track and field event in which the athlete will “put” (but more like of throwing) a shot – a heavy metal ball, the farthest that he can without leaving the circle that is 7 feet wide. To win this, the athlete should put the shot farther among its competitors.
<br>
        <br>
        This sport was known to have started by the Ancient Greeks, but the very first event of it on record was in Scottish Highlands during the first century. In the Middle Ages, there were known competitions for soldiers throwing cannonballs. With time, shot put competitions were included in big events like British Amateur Championships and last 1896, shot put for men became an official event for Olympics. Eventually, shot put competitions for women were also included from 1948.
<br>
        <br>
How to perform the shot put may sound so simple, but winning it requires great deal of balance, coordination, power, and momentum. The shot should be held by the base of the fingers - not the palm, and the hand should be bent back. The shot should be put in the neck and the palm should be facing the putting direction.
        <br>
        <br>
    <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/shot-put-pixabay.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        During the throw or put as it is called, there are different styles that you can use to get the maximum distance. The glide style involves rotating 180 degrees towards the putting direction and there’s the spin style in which the thrower faces the rear, then spins to the throwing direction but giving the upper body a hard twist to get the highest possible throwing momentum.
    </p>
    <h3>Javelin Throw</h3>
    <p>Javelin or javelin throw is part of the track and field event. A javelin or a spear about 8 feet long is used to throw for maximum distance. The participant runs first within a predetermined area and then throws the javelin.
    <br>
        <br>
        The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federation) stated that non-orthodox techniques cannot be used in javelin throw. The participants must hold the javelin at its grip and throw over hands, over the participant’s upper arm or shoulder.
<br>
        <br>
Like other throwing competitions, the participant is not allowed to leave the area until the javelin has landed. The participants throw the javelin towards a sector which has an angle of 28.96 degrees extending outwards from the end of the runway.
<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/athletics/images/javelin-throw-pixabay.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>

    Javelin is a part of the men’s decathlon and the women’s heptathlon. In international competitions, men use a javelin between 8 feet 6 inches and 8 feet 10 inches; the women use a javelin between 7 feet 3 inches and 7 feet 7 inches.
 </p>
    <h3>Hammer Throw</h3>
    <p>Hammer throw is one of the events in track and field competitions. A heavy object on the end of a thin wire is hurled for maximum distance. The game dates back to the 15th century. Hammer throw is one of the oldest events in the Olympic Games.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the men’s division, the hammer weighs around 16 pounds and measures around 3 feet and 11 ¾ inches. For the women’s division, the hammer weighs around 8.82 pounds and measure around 3 feet and 11 inches in length. A winner is decided if he or she can throw the hammer the farthest. It was used to be thought as a strength event, but now it’s more on speed so one can throw the hammer in a farther distance.
<br>
        <br>
        
The action of throwing involves two swings, then around three or four body rotations in circular motion using a heel-toe movement of the foot. This is then moved in a circular path. It gradually increases its velocity, and then the participant throws the ball from the circle.
