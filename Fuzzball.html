    <h1>Fuzzball</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Fuzzball is a sport that was derived from baseball and is played exclusively only in a few regions within the United States. The sport is considered to be a street game, that can be played anywhere, using a bat and a ball. Fuzzball is mostly played as a pickup game at a recreational level.

<br>
 <br>
Fuzzball is mostly played with a tennis ball with its skin removed. There are also official fuzzballs available that are sometimes used. Baseball or corkball bats, broom handles, or official fuzzball bats are used.
<br>
        <br>
the gameplay is similar to that of baseball, with base running, balls and strikes, hits, and outs. A match is played in an innings format where the two teams alternate between batting and pitching. The number of players in a team, number of strikes that count as an out, number of balls that results in a free base run, number of outs that results in the end of an innings, all varies based on what is accepted between the two teams. If space is a limitation, then base running is replaced with virtual base running based on the distance of the hit, similar to corkball.
<br>
        <br>
Fuzzball is a dying sport with not many new players entering the sport. In some regions the sport is used as a means to enter into corkball leagues.
