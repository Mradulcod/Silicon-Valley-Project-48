    <h1>Auto Racing</h1>
      <p>Auto Racing is one of the most popular sports all over the world. It involves automobile car races set to the fastest time over a certain distance or time limit. Auto racing began soon after gasoline fueled automobiles were made.
<br>
        <br>
        The main goal of car racing is to set the fastest time in a set number of rounds or time limit. The final order is determined by total amount of race time, with the fastest time in first place, second place and so on. Any motorist failing to complete a race for any reason is considered as retired, or usually out.
