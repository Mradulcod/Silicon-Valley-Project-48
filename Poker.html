    <h1>Poker</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Poker is a card game that combines gambling, strategy, and skill. The winner of each hand is determined according to the combinations of players' cards. The game involves betting as an intrinsic part of the play.
<br>
<br>
 
Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures. Of the many variations of the game, Texas Hold'em is the most popular.
<br>
        <br>
Poker does not fit our definition of a real sport as it is not primarily a human physical activity, but is included on this list of sports as some people believe it should be.

Poker Becoming A Sport
        <br>
        <br>
In 2010, Poker was officially accepted as a mind sport by the International Mind Sports Association at the organization's congress held in Dubai, UAE.
<br>
        <br>
In 2017, the International Federation of Poker was given 'observer status' by the Global Association of International Sports Federations, paving the way for it to be considered officially a sport
<br>
        <br>
Despite poker featuring on ESPN and having some official recognition, it might be a long time before we see it at the Olympic Games.
