    <h1>Ice Climbing</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        
       Ice climbing is a sport in which athletes climb vertical ice formations, like a frozen waterfalls or cliffs covered with ice, with the use of ropes and other protective gear.
<br>
        <br>
Besides the equipment used for traditional rock climbing, ice climbers also use some additional equipment like, adze, traditional or leashless ice tool, crampons (mono or dual point), and ice screws.
<br>
        <br>
The two most common techniques used for climbing are:
<br>
        <br>
Flat footing: Where feat is opened up so the crampons are pointed right onto the ice.
        <br>
        <br>
Front pointing: Where the front crampons are pierced right onto the ice.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of the other techniques used by climbers are, Cane, Cross-body, Low dagger, High dagger, Anchor, and Traction.

        <br>
Some of the common practices used for navigating the routes are, rope systems - using single or double rope systems, tying-in - attaching the rope to harness, belaying - where fixed or running belays are used, leading - where a leader climbs first followed by others, abseiling - where a fixed rope is used to descend, and lowering - descend using a belayer.
<br>
        <br>
Ice climbing courses vary based on height, angle and the total pitches in the climb, and are classified into nine grades, each of which progressively increases in difficulty.
