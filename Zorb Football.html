    <h1>Zorb Football</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Zorb football is a team sport that was derived from association football in which players are encased in an inflated bubble called a Zorb, covering the entire upper body from waist up including the head.
<br>
        <br>
Zorb football was invented in Norway and currently has found acceptance in the UK, the United States and New Zealand. It is both a physical and a fun game that is played at a recreational and competitive level.

<br>
 <br>
The sport can be played both indoors and outdoors. The field used is similar in size to that of indoor soccer fields. There are goal areas at either end and the objective is to score as many goals as possible.
<br>
        <br>
In zorb football, it is legal for players to run into other players and knock them down regardless of whether they have the ball or not. Players get pushed down all time. Since the players are completely protected there is no risk of injury.

A match is played between two 5-player teams. At the start of the match and after every goal is scored, the ball is placed in the middle of the field and players from both team are positioned at their respective goal lines. Play begins with players from both teams running towards the ball to gain possession and score a goal.
