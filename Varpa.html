    <h1>Varpa</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Varpe is a old Swedish outdoor game developed in the Viking age, and currently played in Gotland, a large Swedish island in the Baltic Sea, where it is the most popular and important sport.

<br>
 <br>
Varpa is similar to Boules, but they throw a flat and heavy thrower known as varpor or varpa, while in Boules they throw a metal ball. Varpa is a word which means throw. The varpor or varpa is made of stone or aluminum. Back in the days, stones were always used, but now aluminum is usually used. The varpa can weigh from a half to five kilos.

The rules of varpa are not that difficult, the object of the game is to throw the stone, or the varpa, as close to a pin as you can. The stick is 15 meters away for women and 20 meters away for men.
<br>
        <br>
You can either compete in a team or individually. If you compete individually, you throw 36 times, and you win if you are the one with the closest to the pin overall.
