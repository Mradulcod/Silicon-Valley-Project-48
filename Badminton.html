    <h1>Badminton</h1>
    <p>Badminton is a type of racket sport that is either played by individuals (singles) or a team of two (doubles). Badminton was developed in British India from a children’s game called 'battledore and shuttlecock'. Badminton was called “Poona” in India in the 18th century. The British Army who were assigned there took the game back to the UK and introduced it to their colleagues. The Duke of Beaufort launched Badminton officially in 1873.

        The equipment needed is a net, shuttlecock, and badminton racket. Players attempt to hit the shuttlecock over the net with the racket. A point is scored if it lands within the opposing side's half of the court. Games are played as singles (one player on each side of the net) or doubles (two players per team).<br>

        A badminton match consists of the best of three games. In the classic format, only the serving side can score, and a team needs 15 points to win.

In the new rally point format, whoever wins the rally scores a point, and a team needs to have 21 points in order to win a game. Each badminton game start at 0-0, which is called “love-all.”
