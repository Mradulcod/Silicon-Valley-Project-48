        Tree climbing championships is a competition which is based on the daily working conditions of arborists. The sport is popular in the United States, Canada and Australia.

<br>
 <br>
The competition consists of two rounds. The first round is the preliminary qualifying round which is followed by the master's challenge round to decide the winner of the championship.
<br>
        <br>

<br>
        <br>

        <br>
In each event, competitors individually work on the tasks against a clock. Each run is scored based on finish time and other factors. The climber with the highest score wins the event.
<br>
        <br>
The score for all the five events combined is used to determine the competitors that will move on to the master's challenge round. The masters' challenge round consists of just one event and it evaluates the competitors based on overall productivity and skill with a rope and saddle in the tree.
