    <br>
        <p>
        Aerobatics is an air sport which usually judges the skills of the pilots who are performing aerobatic flying. This amazing sport is usually practiced in both piston powered airplanes and single engine gliders.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Aerobatics sports competitions are usually authorized by a national aero club or Federation Aeronautique International (FAI). In this sport, a pilot enters the competition according to his/her category of choice, which will define the level of difficulty of the aerobatics stunts he/she is going to be performing in.

            Every flight of the pilot is scored by a panel of judges and ranks every pilot according to his combined scores taken in all flight programs within in every aerobatic stunt category and after that determines that categoryâ€™s winner. The flying aerobatics stunts performed by the pilot in this sport can rolls, stall turns, tail slides and loops.
