    <h1>Jetsprint</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Jetsprint, also known as sprint boat racing, is a high-speed boat racing sport in which a team of two riders, race through a course, by themselves in a time-trial format. The sport originated in New Zealand and later became popular when artificial courses were used in Australia. Only artificial tracks are currently used for all jetsprint competitions.

<br>
 <br>
Typical jetsprint race courses consist of about 25 to 30 turns in both directions, in depths not more than 1 meter. The jetboats used usually have capacity way higher than 500 hp, and one round around the course takes about 45 to 60 seconds. One member of the team steers the boat while other acts as a navigator to guide through the course.
<br>
        <br>
Competitions are conducted in a rounds format. Where half the riders from one round, based on their times, move on to the next round, until the final winner is decided.

There are two major classifications of jetsprint based on engine size and capacity, which are, Class A and Super Boats. Most competitions have races for both classifications.

        <br>
An annual World Championship event is conducted for the sport, which is hosted in Australia, New Zealand and the United States on a rotation basis.
