    <h1>Hammer Throw</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Hammer throw is one of the events in track and field competitions. A heavy object on the end of a thin wire is hurled for maximum distance. The game dates back to the 15th century. Hammer throw is one of the oldest events in the Olympic Games.
<br>
<br>
 
For the men’s division, the hammer weighs around 16 pounds and measures around 3 feet and 11 ¾ inches. For the women’s division, the hammer weighs around 8.82 pounds and measure around 3 feet and 11 inches in length. A winner is decided if he or she can throw the hammer the farthest. It was used to be thought as a strength event, but now it’s more on speed so one can throw the hammer in a farther distance.

        <br>
The action of throwing involves two swings, then around three or four body rotations in circular motion using a heel-toe movement of the foot. This is then moved in a circular path. It gradually increases its velocity, and then the participant throws the ball from the circle.
