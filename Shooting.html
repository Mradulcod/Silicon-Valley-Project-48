    <h1>Shooting</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Shooting as a sport demonstrates the accuracy, control, and speed of the shooter in aiming at targets using guns like pistols and rifles. Shooting sports started more than 500 years ago in European countries. It became popular in the US during the 1950s when a national association for this sport was created. Now, this sport is well-known and enjoyed worldwide.

There are different categories depending on the guns used and the format of the competitions. There are three major guns that are widely used in competition: rifles, pistols, and shotguns.

Rifles are shoulder firearms with long barrels and rifled bores. They are commonly long and require two-hand hold. Popular shooting games using this type of gun are four position small bore, gallery riffle shooting, benchrest shooting, high power rifle (aka Across the Course), biathlon (combination of shooting and cross-country skiing), fullbore target shooting (shooting ranges are at 300- 1200 meters), field target (more popular in UK) and many more.
